# Stay a while and listen
First of all my most important skill: Petting pets

Awesome, right? Even better, you can hire me. But don't get too excited yet.
I may have not seen much of the IT Industry, but what I've seen so far was frustrating.
I want a place and colleagues from which I can learn at the job. And don't have to learn besides.
I want to work with people who are interested and don't reject everything with "I don't have time for that"
I'm sick of wasting my time Google bungling, because no one has a clue what we're doing and is stuck in ancient Times.
